# Basic Image Restoration and Compression Application
## Abstract
The image restoration and compression application implements and analyzes various image processing techniques, without using existing image processing libraries. The application provides an easy to use GUI built on PyQt5 to perform these operations on grayscale and colour images, and is completely implemented in Python. It was tested against a set of degraded images with varying levels of noise (AWGN) and known/unknown blur kernels.   

The application implements the following techniques:

### Image Restoration
* Inverse filtering
* Truncated inverse filtering
* Minimum mean square error (Weiner) filtering
* Constrained least squares filtering

### Image Compression
* DCT-based compression (similar to JPEG)
* Wavelet compression
* SVD-based compression
* Pre-compression filtering options:
  - Gaussian blur
  - Median filter
  - Bilateral filter

## Project Structure
- `main.py` - Main application entry point and GUI controller
- `gui.py` - GUI layout and widget definitions using PyQt5
- `imageRestorationFns.py` - Implementation of image restoration algorithms
- `imageCompressionFns.py` - Implementation of image compression algorithms
- `kernels/` - Directory containing blur kernel definitions
- `images/` - Sample input images for testing

## Dependencies
- Python v3
- PyQt5
- OpenCV (cv2) - For image I/O operations
- NumPy - For numerical computations
